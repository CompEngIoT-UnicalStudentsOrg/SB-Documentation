# Covid spread indoors and temperature humidity levels

the two main factors that contribute to the connection are the “changes in environmental parameters and human behavior.”
Specifically, differences in temperature and humidity affect how stable and transmissible viruses are. For instance, some data reviewed in the new paper suggest that cold, dry, unventilated air may contribute to the transmission of influenza in the winter.

A mouse in an environment with 10% relative humidity had impaired clearance of the influenza virus, compared with mice in an environment with 50% relative humidity.

Those mouses in environment with 10-20% relative humidity succumbed to influenza virus infection more rapidly than those housed in 50% relative humidity.

40-60% may be ideal, studies in mice suggest this, Specifically, 50% contributed in viral clearance and efficient immune response.
Viruses can survive less at a relative humidity of between 47 and 70%. For people, the relative humidity is more pleasant between 45 and 55%.

Many building are poorly ventilated, and people often live in proximity, in this cases, the benefits of higher humidity are mitigated. That why humidifiers are recommended during the winter in buildings. (too much outdoor humidity can also support viral spread)



## Relative humidity of the environment

Normally the percentage of humidity that we find best is 40% or more, physically and psychologically. Ensures a pleasant atmosphere

### Needed Data
- Outdoor air conditions
- Humidifier
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Dimensions of the room

### Recommended humidity and temperature levels

| activity        | temperature | humidity |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Museum          | 21-27       | 40-50    |
| Warehouse       | 24-27       | 40-50    |
| HOSPITAL        |             |          |
| children's room | 24          | 50-65    |
| chirophane      | 24          | 55       |
| Room            | 24          | 40-50    |
