# Covid spread indoors and temperature humidity levels

The two main factors that contribute to the connection are the “changes in environmental parameters and human behavior.”
Specifically, differences in temperature and humidity affect how stable and transmissible viruses are. For instance, some data reviewed in the new paper suggest that cold, dry, unventilated air may contribute to the transmission of influenza in the winter.

A mouse in an environment with 10% relative humidity had impaired clearance of the influenza virus, compared with a mouse in an environment with 50% relative humidity and those mouses in environment with 10-20% relative humidity succumbed to influenza virus infection more rapidly than those housed in 50% relative humidity. the studies in mice suggest 40-60% may be ideal, specifically, 50% contributed in viral clearance and efficient immune response.

Note also that viruses can survive less at a relative humidity of between 47% and 70%.
For people, the relative humidity is more pleasant between 45% and 55%, so in the cases of buildings that are poorly ventilated, and people often live in proximity, the benefits of higher humidity are mitigated. That why humidifiers are recommended during the winter in buildings. (too much outdoor humidity can also support viral spread)

Low humidity may occur in hot, dry desert climates, or indoors in artificially heated spaces. In winter, especially when cold outside air is heated indoors, the humidity may drop to as low as 10–20%. This low humidity can cause adverse health effects, by drying out mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose and throat, lead to a snoring problem, and can cause respiratory distress

Static problems are prevalent in industries such as packaging, printing, paper, plastics, textiles, electronics, automotive manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Friction can produce static buildup and sparks when humidity is below 45% engineers recommended a range of 45–55% RH in data centers to prevent sparks that can damage IT equipment

## Relative humidity of the environment

Normally the percentage of humidity that we find best is 40% or more, physically and psychologically. Ensures a pleasant atmosphere

### Needed Data
- Outdoor air conditions
- Humidifier
- Humidity sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Dimensions of the room

### Recommended humidity and temperature levels

| activity        | temperature | humidity |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Museum          | 21-27       | 40-50    |
| Warehouse       | 24-27       | 40-50    |
| HOSPITAL        |             |          |
| children's room | 24          | 50-65    |
| chirophane      | 24          | 55       |
| Room            | 24          | 40-50    |

### Summary of useful temperature and humidity values

| DESCRIPTION     | TEMPERATURE | HUMIDITY |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Winter indoor   | 21-23       | 40-50    |
| Sumer indoor    | 24-26       | 45-60    |
| Buildings       | 21-26       | 30-60    |
| Pleasant value  | 25          | 45-55    |
| Viruses Survive |             |          |
| less            | ---         | 47-70    |
| Respiratory     |             | under 30 |
| diseases        | over 41     | over 65  |
| Mites           | ---         | 70-80    |

Based on these values, the range of values is presented, for the control of temperature and humidity with respect to safety means due to COVID, winter under 24ºC and summer over 24ºC temperature outdoor.

| Data Type   | WINTER MAX | WINTER MIN | SUMMER MAX | SUMMER  MIN |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| TEMPERATURE | 23         | 21         | 26         | 24          |
| HUMIDITY    | 50         | 47         | 55         | 47          |


## Distancing and humidity
The World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain adopted 1.5 m

Events of very low relative humidity (less than 40% of daily average) are associated with a sharp increase in positive cases of more than 20%. We have two mechanisms linked to the impact of the humidity level on the contagion: dry air favors the survival of the virus inside the drop, and on the other hand it hinders the task of various immune barriers of the respiratory system.
If the air is dry, evaporation is greater, and consequently aerosols containing the virus weigh less and stay longer floating.

Established that a person needs a distance of 1.5 meters around, in a restaurant adds 0.2 m to each one, this space includes corridors and internal decoration, in favorable humidity conditions. If the humidity conditions inside the establishment are critical the distancing should be increased to 2 meters.

### Estimated Capacity
EC = Estimated Capacity of persons within the establishment
Dim = Room Dimensions in square meters
Dis = interpersonal distancing  _*1.5m - 2m*_
AE = Additional space, corridors and internal decoration _*0.2m*_

EC = |Dim/(Dis+AE)|
