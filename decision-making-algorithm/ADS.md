# Algorithmic Decision Making

Describing a decision-making system as an “algorithm” is often a way to deflect accountability for human decisions. For many, the term implies a set of rules based objectively on empirical evidence or data. It also suggests a system that is highly complex.

Algorithmic decision system (**ADS**): algorithms are nevertheless increasingly involved in systems used to support decision making (ADS), these systems often rely on the analysis of large amounts of personal data to infer correlations or, more generally, to derive information deemed useful to make decisions. In many situations, the impact of the decision on people can be significant. Different requirements such as transparency, explainability, data protection and accountability are often presented as ways to limit these risks
TIPES:
ADS that aim at improving general knowledge or technology: ADS use algorithms to generate new knowledge, generally through the analysis of complex phenomena. Algorithms are crucial in this context since they can be used to analyse very large datasets to extract knowledge.
ADS that aim at improving or developing new digital services: Applications of this category are used to help make predictions, recommendations or decisions in various áreas
ADS integrated within cyber physical systems: are used to provide autonomy to physical objects by limiting human supervisión

## DESIDERATA FOR ALGORITHMS

main approaches proposed in the literature to reduce the risks identified.

- safety: absence of error in a system, capacity to deliver correct results
- Security: protection of the system against adversarial attacks, (confidentiality, integrity or availability)
- Privacy: protection of personal data
- Intrinsic requirements, such as fairness, absence of bias or non-discrimination
- Extrinsic requirements, such as understandability
- Transparency: availability of the ADS code
- Explainability: delivery of information beyond the ADS itself
- Accountability: in the context of algorithmic decision-making, an accountable decision-maker must provide its decision-subjects with reasons and explanations for the design and operation of its automated decision-making system.
