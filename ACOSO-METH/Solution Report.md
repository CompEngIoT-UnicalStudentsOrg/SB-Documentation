# ACOSO-METH

The main aim of this file is to explain what we need and the main phases to follow in order to use the "ACOSO-METH" framework for modelling, designing, implementing and deploying a clear IoT System based on a SMART BUILFDING.

The 3 main phases are:

- Analysis
- Design
- Impementation

These three are based on showing/drawing metamodels like:

# ANALYSIS - Metamodel

# DESIGN - Metamodel 

- based on Agents

# IMPLEMENTATION - Metamodel

- based on Jade

# SERVICE MODEL | SERVICE PROFILE

Now it is required to extends the IoT Services proposed in our metamodels with their "service model" and "service profile"

# PETRI NET

Could be fine and useful implement a little petri net, in which services and their events are modelled.

(we have to ask to professors)
