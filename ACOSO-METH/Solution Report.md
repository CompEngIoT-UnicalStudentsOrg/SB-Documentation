## How to contribute

When you start researching a topic, create a folder where to put your research results and open a new branch; commits going on that folder should be committed on your branch.

When you finish with that research, open a pull request to merge your contributions on the main branch.

Documents are preferred in Markdown format (.md) or as normal text files (.txt).
