# Digital Ocean

Digital ocean is the simplest alternative we have to deploy our application on the cloud. 

I already have some experience with this platform, I used it for a personal project once and I think I could replicate the architecture for our purposes without any problem.

Link to personal project as a reference: [moody arch on a swarm network](https://github.com/Abathargh/moody-do-swarm).

### Pros
- 100â‚¬ credit in the github education pack for students
- easy to use both via website and terminal
- native support for docker-machine based deploy and virtual node administration

### Cons
- Requires a bit of knowledge of the specific tools to create the architecture from the ground up
