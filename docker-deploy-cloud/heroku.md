# Heroku

Heroku is probably the easiest way we have to deploy our app on the cloud. Easy to setup, deploy and start.

### Pros

- Free hour pool (550 hrs) by default + possibility of having more by coupling a card + github student pack
- Really easy to setup, very simple apps deployed in ~10 mins
- support for heroku based docker registries

### Cons

- forced to use credit/debit card
- little bit difficult to use for more complex stuff/architectures
- docker support is a bit more tedious to setup than on digitalocean
